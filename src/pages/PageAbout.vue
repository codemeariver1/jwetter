        This is a project started on May 17, 2022 and made by Steven Joseph.
        This was meant as a way for me to practice and learn more on dynamic web
        apps by incorporating the technologies: Vue.js, Quasar Framework, and
        Firebase. This app is fully responsive and has the ability to work
        cross-platform! My end goal with this project is to have a deployable
        app that not only works on web but such that I may be able put in all
        devices. I give thanks to freeCodeCamp and Danny Connell for their
        knowledge and guidance on this endeavor.
